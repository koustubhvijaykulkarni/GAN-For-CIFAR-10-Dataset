# GAN-For-CIFAR-10-Dataset
The objective of this project is to learn and implement Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating samples. We will learn and implement two types of GANs- 1. Deep Convolu- tion GAN (DCGAN) 2.Self-Attention GAN (SA-GAN). The dataset we are using is CIFAR-10 dataset.
